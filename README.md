# thelibrary
This Flutter app is a knowledge library with a “Library Index” header, search bar, and grid of category cards showing descriptions and article counts. A slide‑out navigation drawer opens from a hamburger icon, enabling quick access to main sections and easy extension to detailed article and category screens.
